This is a progamming portafolio that I'm building from my Programming 101 class. 
Please see some of the projects I've worked on in this class, such as "Cipher", "Guess The Country", "Adopt A Robot", "Study Application", and "Blue Light." 
I'm still learning a lot so please know this is just the beggining of a long journey I've started on my programming career. :)
